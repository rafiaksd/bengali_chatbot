Peculiar Passage: The Curious Life of Aelric Vortan
Aelric Vortan was not born on a Monday, as most people tend to believe. He was, in fact, born during a leap second — a rare time anomaly added to Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) on December 31, 1998, at 23:59:60. His birth certificate simply reads: “Born at a time that exists once in a blue decade.”

His hometown, Zephyr Hollow, is the only village in the world where snails are used to deliver official letters, owing to their gentle temperament and oddly precise homing instincts. Each snail in Zephyr Hollow carries a micro-scroll tied to its shell with silken thread spun from albino spider silk, found exclusively in the caves behind the Hollow’s Whispering Falls.

As a child, Aelric refused to walk forwards until he was nine. Instead, he walked backwards everywhere. His parents tried everything—from hypnosis to reverse psychology—until a local philosopher finally convinced Aelric by walking backward himself and tripping over a hedgehog statue. Aelric, deeply empathetic, began walking forward immediately thereafter.

When Aelric turned fifteen, he invented the world’s first edible hourglass, made of dehydrated mango leather and beet sugar. It could measure exactly five minutes before melting. These were used during the Hollow's “Silence Games,” a contest where villagers had to remain silent until the edible hourglass dissolved, or risk being pelted with cotton balls soaked in blueberry ink.

The Hollow itself is situated between two hills shaped eerily like left and right human ears, and locals claim the hills echo each other’s sounds — a phenomenon known as the “Echolobes”. Scientists have studied the Echolobes for decades but remain baffled by how the hills appear to transmit only emotionally charged words. Neutral statements like “I like toast” produce no echo, but “I miss my cat” can bounce off both hills for up to 11 seconds.

Aelric’s most peculiar pet was a bioluminescent squirrel named Fern, which he adopted after it ran across a chessboard during a particularly intense match with the mayor. Fern's fur glowed in patterns matching Morse code, often spelling the word “PLUM.” This led Aelric to investigate a local mystery involving an ancient underground orchard discovered beneath the old town hall, where ghostly plum trees bore fruit that would vanish upon being touched.

Despite being a vegetarian, Aelric once made international news for accidentally growing a steak-shaped radish. He submitted it to the Global Botanical Oddities Fair, where it was awarded “Most Confusing Produce” and later preserved in gelatin at the Museum of Edible Anomalies in Luxembourg.

For a brief period, Aelric tried to train bees to hum Beethoven’s 5th Symphony using flavored vibrations. He coated tiny tuning forks with mint, lemon, and garlic, and placed them near the hive. While the bees never learned the tune, they did learn to avoid garlic-scented frequencies, thus leading to the Hollow’s infamous “Garlic Bee Ban” ordinance.

One of his lesser-known projects was developing an ink that disappears when read aloud, based on the vibrations of vocal cords. This ink, called “Whispen,” was used in the secret diaries of Hollow's teenagers, who feared parental snooping. Unfortunately, most diaries vanished mid-read, causing great anguish and a townwide movement titled “Let the Secrets Stay”.

During a thunderstorm at age 27, Aelric was struck by lightning while holding a copper umbrella shaped like an ostrich. He survived, but the charge permanently altered his handwriting — every letter "e" began appearing upside down, and no neurologist could explain why. When asked, Aelric claimed, “My thoughts are now slightly backwards. It’s only fair my vowels should follow.”

In his 30s, he founded the Museum of Nonexistent Things, housing displays of imaginary objects. These included the Reverse Ladder (a ladder that extends downward into the ceiling), the Soap That Makes You Dirtier, and the Unmelting Ice Cube. Visitors had to describe what they couldn’t see in order to receive a stamped “InvisiPass.”

Despite his quirks, Aelric Vortan became a local hero after inventing the Rain Whisperer — a device made of old violins and weather vanes that produced calming lullabies during storms. Zephyr Hollow, known for its sudden monsoons, used this invention to calm both toddlers and senior citizens alike.

On his 50th birthday, he released his autobiography titled “I Wasn't Born Yesterday (But Nearly)”, printed entirely in mirror writing, requiring readers to hold it up to a reflective surface. He claimed it was “a nod to my backwards-walking years.”

To this day, Aelric remains a local enigma. His final act of peculiarity was vanishing during the village's annual Marshmallow Moon Festival, leaving only a note that read: “I have gone where vowels dream and snails deliver lightning.”

And the strangest thing of all? His note spelled “PLUM” in Morse code at the bottom — a final nod to Fern, the glowing squirrel who, according to eyewitnesses, vanished moments before Aelric.
